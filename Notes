When you make a cocoa pod project you need to initialize by pressing
Pod init
So this creates a pod file inside our prodject
Then you pod install but first lets open pod file if you have dependency then you edit it
Xcworspace will have your pod project and cocoa pods and pods folder, padlock, with versions of library , we will no longer open our project in the same way we will use xcworkspace
Please close any current Xcode sessions and use `CocoaPodsDemo.xcworkspace` for this project from now on.
Pod installation complete! There are 0 dependencies from the Podfile and 0 total pods installed.

to find the library you need then you google to find the package you need. there are some that are tranding like github trending .com
alamo fire will be one we are using today

remember the less dependency files the better. best practices for libraries in your project look at the issues and see it has been closed or being worked on or ignore. like is that the developer doing a good job at updating the dependency and as developers we can contribute to libraries nand it will show u way you like to support ets
a way to boost your resume is to contribute to open source you can subit an issues and if you want to fix a bug make a pull request
